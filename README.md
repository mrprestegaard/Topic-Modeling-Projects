# | **Method**                 | Probabilistic model              | Matrix factorization            |
# | **Mathematical Framework** | Probabilistic inference          | Linear algebra (non-negative matrix decomposition) |
# | **Output**                 | Probabilities of words per topic and topics per document | Non-negative weights for words per topic and topics per document |
# | **Interpretability**       | Less interpretable, probabilistic values | More interpretable, non-negative weights |
# | **Assumption**             | Probabilistic topic mixtures     | Non-negative matrix factorization |
# | **Scalability**            | Slower, more complex             | Faster, simpler                  |
# | **Common Use**             | Mixed-topic documents            | Easily interpretable topic modeling |
# | **Overlapping Topics**     | Models topic mixtures well       | Less flexible with overlapping topics |
